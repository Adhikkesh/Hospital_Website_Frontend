    <h2 class="middle1">Plan your trip</h2>
    <p class="middle2">We understand that seeking medical care outside your home country can be a physically and emotionally exhausting experience, and we know that it can be a stressful ordeal. The International Patient Department at various Apollo Hospital locations strives to ensure that you not only feel at home during your stay but also to ensure you return to your country in good health.</p>

    <h3 id="process">PROCESS</h2>
    <p>The International Patient Department at Apollo Hospitals was established to assist patients in planning and preparing their travel plans to the hospital. At Apollo Hospitals, we strive not only to provide world-class medical care and procedures, but also to ensure that you feel most comfortable and at ease during your treatment with us.</p>
    <p>You can refer to the information below to plan your trip to Apollo Hospital. If you prefer to have a representative personally help you prepare, please use the contact form on the right to communicate with the International Representative.</p>

    <br><br>

    <h3 id="documents">DOCUMENTS REQUIRED</h2>
    <p>When planning to travel abroad, it is important to prepare and bring the necessary documents to ensure a smooth and hassle-free experience.</p>
    <strong>Here is a list of documents that you need to bring before your departure to India:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Report your medical/medical history or any statements relating to past or ongoing treatment sessions.</li><br>
        <li>Photocopy of Vaccination Certificate (Yellow Fever, Polio, etc.), X-ray, MRI, immunization records, prescription,
            and relevant medical documents including records of previous operations. Make sure you have this medical report and
            related drugs with you at all times in your bag or carry-on baggage.</li><br>
        <li>Passport and Visa are a must; check with our International Travel Desk regarding Visa requirements, depending on
            the country you are traveling to.</li><br>
        <li>Bring local currency, travelers checks, and/or credit and debit cards.</li>
    </ul>

    <br><br>

    <h3 id="liability">LIABILITY</h3>
    <p>At Apollo Hospitals, we work with a number of International Insurance providers. You can get a list from the International Patient Desk/Admissions Counter or contact the International Representative to learn more. As a side note, we are unable to process or accept foreign insurance coverage that is not listed.</p>
    <p>Insurance coverage for companies on our list applies only to inpatient procedures (48 hours of hospitalization) and approval from the insurance provider is required. A deposit is required upon entry to the inpatient billing department. The deposit amount will be refunded once your insurance provider allows payment of the treatment. If insurance coverage is not provided within 48 hours of admission, you will need to pay the hospital bill and claim reimbursement from your insurance provider at a later date.</p>

    <br><br>

    <h3 id="kost">AIRPORT KOST</h3>
    <p>Mantra Apollo Hospitals is Tender Loving Care and we believe it should start with your arrival. All Apollo International locations arrange airport assistance and transfers for our clients. Some locations also have special kiosks or clinics at the airport. Call us at the counter once you arrive and we will make sure to assist you from the airport.</p>
